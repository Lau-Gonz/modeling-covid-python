    "- *A detailed explanation of the laws around which your model is formulated.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEI3RD model, like many epidemiological models, is based on a set of differential equations that describe the dynamics of disease transmission within a population. We can consider for this case some laws and concepts to understand the SEI3RD model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Law of Mass Action**: The SEI3RD model assumes that disease transmission occurs through interactions between individuals. The rate of new infections is proportional to the number of susceptible individuals and the number of infectious individuals, following the law of mass action. This is represented in the equations for the transmission of the disease (the terms involving β0(t), β1(t), β2, and β3), where β represents the transmission rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exponential Growth and Decay**: The model uses exponential growth and decay principles to describe the transitions between compartments. For instance, the exposed (E) individuals become infectious (I) at a rate ω, and infectious individuals recover or progress to a more severe stage at a rate δ.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compartmental Modeling**: The SEI3RD model divides the population into compartments based on disease status. These compartments include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S$ (Susceptible): Individuals who are at risk of getting infected.\n",
    "- $E$ (Exposed): Individuals who are infected but not yet infectious.\n",
    "- $I_0$, $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$ (Infectious): Individuals in different infectious stages or with different levels of severity.\n",
    "- $R$ (Recovered): Individuals who have recovered from the disease and are immune.\n",
    "- $D$ (Deceased): Individuals who have succumbed to the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transmission Rate Variation**: The model allows for time-varying transmission rates (β0(t) and β1(t)), which acknowledge that disease transmission may change over time due to various factors such as interventions, seasonality, or behavioral changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fractional Disease Progression**: The δ parameters represent the fraction of individuals who progress to a more severe state (or die) from the current state, while (1 - δ) represents the fraction who recover or remain in the same state.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Latent Period and Incubation Period**: The E compartment represents individuals who are exposed to the virus but not yet infectious. This accounts for the incubation period during which an infected individual is not yet capable of transmitting the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Vital Dynamics**: The model assumes a closed population, which means it doesn't explicitly consider births and deaths unrelated to the disease. However, it does account for disease-induced mortality in the D compartment.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Immunity**: The R compartment represents individuals who have recovered from the disease and are assumed to be immune. This reflects the idea that individuals who have recovered from an infection may be protected from reinfection for a certain period.\n"
